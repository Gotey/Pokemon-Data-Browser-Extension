# Current looks and Features
Right now the extension only shows the sprite, name, types, cries (if you click on the sprite), and Base Stats. It also has a cache with the latest 5 entries implemented because I was tired of having to call the API everytime. This is a screenshot of how it currently looks in both dark and light themes with my goat Lugia:

# Planning to add
- Easy access to different forms for Pokemon that have it
- Evolutions and their respective levels
- Moves and their respective levels/ methods to learning them
- Abilities
- Links to bigger resources like celebi, bulbapedia, etc.
- maybe places where to catch them and more idk...

# Current issues
Currently some Pokemon are not easily searchable, like Giratina, Deoxys, etc. This is because they have different forms (Deoxys Attack / Deoxys Defense) and the way I'm interacting with the API is not really compatible with how the thing keeps the names of the creatures. Also the positioning is a bit weird (in terms of how the components are held in place) as it looks all organized just because the bars occupy all available space lol totally planned. So yeah.
